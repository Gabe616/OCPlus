# OCUndoRedo
This is a script I coded which allows you to undo/redo your actions (moving objects, deleting parts, etc)

## Script
The current version is **v0.2-ALPHA**, but the script isn't available to everyone yet.
## FaQ
- Can I get the script?
  - Nope, not yet. I will be releasing an obfuscated version soon™ though.
- Will I get banned if I use this?
  - Another no, Mario is okay with exploits like these which only enhance gameplay.
