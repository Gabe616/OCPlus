# Features
--- 
## Improved Settings 
The settings panel is upgraded with several OC+ additions that can be toggled to enhance your experience building. 
- Revert to old lighting 
- UI dark mode 
- Undo & redo keybinds 
- Text Enhancements

## UI Dark Mode 
As a heavily requested feature, OC+ has moderate support for dark mode. It simply inverts and monochrome Obby Creator’s color scheme, this creates a much nicer interface to look at night. Simply toggle it in settings. 

## Text Enhancements 
These improve OC’s text making them crisper. These ranges from the interface to billboards, to signs and gates to text effects. 

## Undo & Redo 
OC+ features a simple UI for undo & redoing with a timeline to log changes and changable keybinds. What more can you ask?

Heres all of the stuff you can undo and redo in glory:
- moving, resizing, rotating parts
- changing advanced tools properties
- changing an object's properties
- changing an object's effects
- changing the global properties
- creating a new part
- changing an object's behaviour (moving part, spin part, etc)
- cloning an object
- deleting an object

And heres all of the keybinds for undo & redo:
| Keybind          | Purpose                                |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| H                | Toggles History                        |
| Ctrl + Z         | Undo **(keybind can be changed)**      |
| Ctrl + X         | Undo                                   |
| Ctrl + Y         | Redo **(keybind can be changed)**      |
| Ctrl + Shift + Z | Redo                                   |

# FAQ

**Q: Can I get the script?**

Go right ahead! This one-liner should do the trick:

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gabe616/OCPlus/main/loader.lua"))()
```

**Q: Will I get banned if I use OCPlus?**

No. mario118118 is fine with exploits being used in his games for gameplay enhancement. This isn't the same outside of Obby Creator though, so don't try porting this over other games without expecting punishment.

**Q: What executors can I use?**

Take a look below!
