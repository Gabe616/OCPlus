## FAQ

### Q: Will I get banned if I use OCPlus?

No. mario118118 is fine with exploits being used in his games for gameplay enhancement. This isn't the same outside of Obby Creator though, so don't try porting this over other games without expecting punishment.

### Q: Help! The script throws Error 409.

This should already be fixed in 0.3 Alpha, it revolved around an issue with loading the HistoryFrame.
